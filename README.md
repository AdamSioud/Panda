# Panda
Exploring the Pandas library

The journey starts with "Learning the Pandas Library: Python Tools for Data Munging, Analysis, and Visual 1st Edition" By Matt Harrison

In addition to this I will search around other sources while reading the book, to get a better understanding, mostly videos. Found a great guy who had a video
on pandas series, I will be watching him more. When it comes to learning pandas, here is his a link to his somewhat of a tutorial https://github.com/knathanieltucker/pandas-tutorial. I will be using this side by side with the book.
